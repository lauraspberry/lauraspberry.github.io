		<h3>Summary</h3>

            filter them by time, and upon completion, you can interact with and customize our adorable mascot :)</p>

		<h3>What I did</h3>
		<p>I organized a team of 4 by evaluating requests for the team and balancing out what each team member can bring 
            to the project, whether that was backend, authentication, or strong presentation skills. I also created the illustrations, 
            made animations, implemented our design into code, and collaborated on backend logic. </p>

		<h3>Learning and Growth // Takeaway</h3>
		<p>Our project was definitely technically intensive, and I gained a lot more experience around how I could set up a 
            database in the cloud with different features. I also learned a lot about how to implement authentication via email, 
            and was able to apply my experience in Flask to this project. </p>
		<p>Besides the technical skills, I also learned a lot about leading and working with a team. I hadn’t considered how important 
            checking in with each team member individually would be for team morale, or how easily miscommunication or conflicts can arise. 
            We were able to resolve all (merge) conflicts though, and I also had a blast leading design and onboarding my teammate to Figma, leading design, 
            and overall creating a cool project.</p>
