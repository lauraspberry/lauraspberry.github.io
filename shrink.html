		<h3>Summary</h3>
		<p>A 2D platformer game designed with levels and puzzles. This game follows the adventure of a slime ball, who is trapped in a science laboratory. He is trying to escape through the exit, but they're too small for him! He must shrink himself using the shrink rays to move on. </p>

		<h3>What I did</h3>
		<p>I worked with a partner to develop this 2D platformer game using the Unity game engine. Specifically, I implemented the movement scripts and shrinking scripts for events in the game. I also created the player, animated the player, and designed three levels for strategy and immersion. </p>

		<h3>Learning and Growth // Takeaway</h3>
		<p>This project was really valuable in that I was able to apply the skills I learned taking the game design class and create a complete game. It was very satisfying seeing the things I learned come to life in a cute and fun project that my friends could try out easily! Trying to collaborate with a partner was also a learning experience, since we had to establish a workflow for sharing projects and pushing or pulling large files from GitHub.  </p>
